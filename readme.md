# Payment and Orders Microservices (Project Name)

This is the main repository of the project housing the Payment and Orders microservices.

## Introduction

This project aims to showcase the implementation of the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture for Payment and Orders systems, utilizing TypeScript and RabbitMQ technologies. It is important to emphasize that this repository does not focus on the main file structure but rather on the domain and application layers, delving into the implementation details of these microservices.

## Technologies Used

- TypeScript: The programming language used for developing the microservices.
- RabbitMQ: A message broker service used for communication between microservices.

## Architecture

Our application adheres to the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD), dividing the domain into independent microservices. The primary components are:

- **Payment**: Responsible for the entire payment process.
- **Orders (Order)**: Manages customer orders.
